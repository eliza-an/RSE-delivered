          <p>Why we started &</p> 
          <h2> What we aim to achieve</h2> 
          <p>Unfortunately, young people suffer as a result of an insufficient relationships and sex education, with it resulting in higher rates of teenage pregnancy1, an inability to set and maintain personal boundaries2 and proliferation of prejudices and disrespectful behaviour3.</p>
          <p>Our goal is to help create a world where young people have access to a comprehensive relationships and sex education that equips them with the knowledge and self-esteem they require in order to make healthy decisions in their platonic, romantic and sexual relationships and empowers them with knowledge of their own health and wellbeing.</p>
          <p>We aim to do this by providing an experienced service that: delivers evidence and empathy based workshops with young people; aids teachers professional development through a variety of adaptable formats; and offers curriculum guidance and consultation based on the government guidance4 and staff, parent and governor insight. </p>
